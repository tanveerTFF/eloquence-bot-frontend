Features
Chatbot Interface: The website has an interactive chatbot that allows users to ask for quotes based on specific moods or categories.

Quote Refresh: A refresh button that fetches 5 new random quotes from the selected category.

Smooth Navigation: The site allows smooth navigation between different quote categories with scroll snap for a clean user experience.

Technologies Used
Frontend
React.js: The frontend of the site is built using React for a dynamic user interface and component-based architecture.

Vite: Vite is used for bundling the frontend assets. It offers fast build times and better developer experience.

Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS is used for styling. It is a utility-first CSS framework that provides flexible styling with easy customization.

Vercel: The frontend is deployed on Vercel, offering continuous integration and deployment straight from GitHub.

Backend
Node.js & Express: The backend is built using Node.js with the Express framework, allowing for easy routing and API setup.

MongoDB: Quotes and user interactions are stored in MongoDB, providing a flexible database solution with fast read and write operations.

Groq API: Used to detect user intent and categorize the requests based on mood. This makes the chatbot smarter and capable of understanding various types of user queries.

Railway: The backend is deployed on Railway, offering simple cloud infrastructure and environment management.

Key Features and Techniques Implemented
Quote Recommendation Logic:

The chatbot uses Groq to detect the user's intent and provide relevant quotes. For example, if the user says "I want something funny," Groq classifies the intent, and the system fetches funny quotes.

Session Management:

The chat history is stored and maintained via MongoDB, allowing users to see past interactions.

Each user has a session ID, ensuring their interactions are persistent even if the page is reloaded.

Dynamic Quote Fetching:

The quotes are fetched dynamically based on the user's mood or category, from the backend API which is connected to MongoDB.

The backend uses the Groq API to determine if the user is asking for a motivational quote, romantic quote, etc.

User Interface:

The interface is designed with clean, minimal, and modern aesthetics using Tailwind CSS. The layout is fully responsive and adapts across devices.

The quotes section is styled with a white background and black text to ensure readability and consistency in design.

A refresh button allows users to get new random quotes from their selected category.

Smooth Scrolling:

The page utilizes scroll snap behavior for a smooth transition between sections. This makes it feel like users are navigating through full-page slides.

How It Works
Frontend (React + Vercel):

The React frontend interacts with the backend to fetch quotes and display them. The user interacts with the chatbot, and based on the user input, the appropriate API call is made to fetch the corresponding quotes.

Backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB + Railway):

The Express API listens for requests from the frontend and interacts with MongoDB to fetch quotes based on categories. It uses the Groq API to detect the mood or intent behind the userâ€™s query and provide an appropriate response.

Deployment:

Frontend is deployed on Vercel, ensuring automatic deployments from GitHub with continuous integration.

Backend is deployed on Railway, which handles the API routes, database connections, and quote fetching functionalities.
